# Fugu15_rootful

What does this fork fix?

* Fixes RootFS (root pivoting - Replaced with mountrfs)

Plans:

ProjectTC will hopefully fix this TC loading issue. Shouldn't be too "Trivial" but hopefully this will be the end all, be all.

Planning to automate bootstrapFS by putting a list of the disks into a txt file for mountrfs to read from and automatically bootstrap.

After that, I (rebeldisc) will stop with open-source. This fork does not have all my changes and this will be the last of it. 

# Thanks for corporating with me on my journey.
