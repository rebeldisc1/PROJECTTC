# Fugu15_rootful

What does this fork fix?

* Fixes RootFS (root pivoting - Replaced with mountrfs)

Plans:

ProjectTC will hopefully fix this TC loading issue. Shouldn't be too "Trivial" but hopefully this will be the end all, be all.

Planning to automate bootstrapFS by putting a list of the disks into a txt file for mountrfs to read from and automatically bootstrap.

After that, I (rebeldisc) will stop with open-source. This fork does not have all my changes and this will be the last of it. 

## Q/A:

Q:
"I am not a part of the Rebellious Developer Program, Should I use this?"

A:
Hell no, so far this project has caused around 7 bootloops by several people. (didn't know what they were doing)
It's not worth messing with if you don't know what your doing.

Q:
"Will you ever add support for Arm64 devices?"

A:
Not as of right now. At this rate, I don't see it happening but I don't think it's impossible.
They are obsolete so I don't really see a point.

Q:
"What about KFD? Wil you ever make it work?"

A:
Yeah, it's planned to make it work in the future. This should help spring boarding into iOS 16 support later. (Might not happen)

This is a very variable situation and I would love to push it as soon as possible.



# Thanks for corporating with me on my journey.
